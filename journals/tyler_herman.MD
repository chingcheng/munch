Week 14 Day 2
February 14, 2023

Today we worked as a team to delineate microservices and databases. Then we created our first issue and updated our docker-compose.yaml file to get our project started. I used Live Share for the first time and setup a yaml file from scratch with my team. Doing it with a group of five made it a lot easier. Looking forward to getting everything up and running so we can get some tangible results.
